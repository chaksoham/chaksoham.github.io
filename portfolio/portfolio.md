## Cellorganizer
The CellOrganizer project provides tools for
- learning generative models of cell organization directly from images
- storing and retrieving those models
- synthesizing cell images (or other representations) from one or more models

## VR APP
HyattVR allows you to practice your public speaking skills in a VR environment. After delivering your presentation, review it from the audience’s perspective in a virtual playback setting and get feedback on your performance.

## Cloud Computing

This project-based on-line course focuses on skill building across various aspects of cloud computing. We cover conceptual topics and provide hands-on experience through projects utilizing public cloud infrastructures Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Students will utilize MapReduce, interactive programming using Jupyter Notebooks, and data science libraries to clean, prepare and analyze a large data set. Students will orchestrate the deployment of auto-scaled, load-balanced and fault-tolerant applications using virtual machines (VMs), Docker containers and Kubernetes, as well as serverless computing through Functions as a Service. Students will explore and experiment with different distributed cloud-storage abstractions (distributed file systems and databases) and compare their features, capabilities, applicability and consistency models. In addition, students will develop different analytics applications using batch, iterative and stream processing frameworks. The 15-619 [graduate] students will participate in a team project, which entails designing and implementing a complete web-service solution for querying big data. For the team project, the student teams are evaluated based on the cost and performance of their web service.

## Practical Data Science
This course provides a practical introduction to the “full stack” of data science analysis, including data collection and processing, data visualization and presentation, statistical model building using machine learning, and big data techniques for scaling these methods. Topics covered include: collecting and processing data using relational methods, time series approaches, graph and network models, free text analysis, and spatial geographic methods; analyzing the data using a variety of statistical and machine learning methods include linear and non-linear regression and classification, unsupervised learning and anomaly detection, plus advanced machine learning methods like kernel approaches, boosting, or deep learning; visualizing and presenting data, particularly focusing the case of high-dimensional data; and applying these methods to big data settings, where multiple machines and distributed computation are needed to fully leverage the data.

## Data structures for Application Developers
It covers the conceptual and implementation views of some common data structures and algorithms. It also goes over the Java Collections (such as List, ArrayList, LinkedList, Set, HashSet, TreeSet, Map, HashMap, TreeMap, PriorityQueue) to solidify the understanding of the data structures. There is an introduction to the analysis of algorithms that operate on them.

## Databses and management
 Databases systems are central to most organizations’ information systems strategies. At any organizational level, users can expect to have frequent contact with database systems. Therefore, skill in using such systems – understanding their capabilities and limitations, knowing how to access data directly or through technical specialists, knowing how to
effectively use the information such systems can provide, and skills in designing new systems and related applications – is a distinct advantage and necessity today. 
 - Gain good understanding of relational data model in terms of data structure, data integrity, and data manipulation.  
 - Understand and create conceptual database models utilizing entity-relationship modeling.  
 - Design data structures that will limit redundancy and enforce data integrity while conforming to organizational requirements utilizing normalization methodology. 
 - Understand the theory behind the relational data model as it applies to interactions with current database management systems.  
 - Read and interpret a given data model to query the database and transform the data into information using Structured Query Language (SQL).  
 - Implement a data model in a current relational database management system.  
 - Create reports, based on transactional data, including elements such as data groupings and summary values.  

# NoSQL Database Management
 The widespread emergence of big data storage needs has driven the development and adoption of a new class of non-relational databases commonly referred to as NoSQL databases. This course will explore the origins of NoSQL databases and the characteristics that distinguish them from traditional relational database management systems. Core concepts of NoSQL databases will be presented, followed by an exploration of how different database technologies implement these core concepts. We will take a closer look at 1-2 databases from each of the four main NoSQL data models (key-value, column family, document, and graph), highlighting the business needs that drive the development and use of each database. Finally, we will present criteria that decision makers should consider when choosing between relational and non-relational databases and techniques for selecting the NoSQL database that best addresses specific use cases.
 - Used redis
 - Used Neo4j
 - Used Mongodb
 - Used Cassandra
 Worked on various use cases for heterogenous database modeling and effectiveness of various Relational, NoSQL and NewSQL based databases.
